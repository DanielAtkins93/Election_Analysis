# Election_Analysis

## Overview

In this analysis we are helping Tom, a Colorado board of elections employee, audit an election & tabulate the results of a congressional district in his state. Our initial goal was to determine the total number of votes cast, total number of votes for each candidate, the percentages of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election. Upon a new request by the election commission, our scope has expanded to also include: voter turnout by county, the percentage of votes from each county, and the county with the highest turnout.
