# Election_Analysis

## Overview

In this analysis we are helping Tom, a Colorado board of elections employee, audit an election & tabulate the results of a congressional district in his state. Our initial goal was to determine the total number of votes cast, total number of votes for each candidate, the percentages of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election. Upon a new request by the election commission, our scope has expanded to also include: voter turnout by county, the percentage of votes from each county, and the county with the highest turnout.

## Election-Audit Summary

In summary, our analysis came to two practical uses for this script:

  1). The script can be modified to replace "county" with "state" or "city", depending on what level of analysis the user is looking for.
  
  2). Upon making either of these modifications, the data could be used on a look-forward basis to generate greater voter insight for state and federal elections. Candidates could use this script to target certain areas for campaigning in an attempt to gain potential swing-votes. A further step would be an analysis of these voters and whether or not they are likely to change their vote for a candidate.
